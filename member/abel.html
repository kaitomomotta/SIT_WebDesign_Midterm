              Hi! I’m Abel, and I’m currently a computer science student at Shibaura Institute of Technology. Usually, I study at Epita, a computer engineering school in France. Over there, we don’t do much web designing : mostly programming in C, C#, Python, and even Ocaml when the teachers feel like torturing us (they do it often).

        <p style="color:white;">Even though I started out as a physics student and reoriented myself towards computer science, it’s a choice I don’t regret making at all ! I find computers very entertaining, and learning the ins and outs of these machines is amazing. I’m not the most skilled nor the most knowledgeable about programming, so every new notion is like a fun new adventure (or a painful disaster, it depends). Web design and HTML/CSS are very new to me, so I’m working extra hard !<br>
          As of my hobbies, I’m your average international student in Japan : anime, tv shows, videogames, I love them all. I’m a big fan of corny, campy sitcoms, and I need stupid reality TV to keep me functioning as a human being. I’d say the thing I’m the most proud of is my digital art skills I’ve been honing since the start of the 2020 lockdown. I’m still not there yet, but comparing my most recent piece to anything I’ve done in 2020, the difference is night and day!</p>

              France is a country that has it all: culture, cuisine, architecture, art, history, and cheese. Lots of cheese. Some of the most iconic attractions in France include the Arc de Triomphe, which is a giant arch that celebrates French victories and traffic jams; the Eiffel Tower, which is a metal tower that was supposed to be temporary but became a symbol of Paris and romance; the Palace of Versailles, which is a lavish palace that showcases the extravagance and downfall of the French monarchy; and the Louvre Museum, which is a huge museum that houses thousands of artworks, including the Mona Lisa, who always looks like she knows something you don't. 
            </p>
            <p>
              France is also home to diverse landscapes, from the lavender fields of Provence that smell like heaven to the snow-capped peaks of Mont Blanc that challenge the adventurous. One of the coolest regions in France is Alsace, which is located on the border with Germany and Switzerland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alsace has a unique culture and identity, influenced by its Germanic heritage and its wine-making tradition. Alsace is known for its picturesque villages, colorful half-timbered houses, medieval castles, and delicious food such as flammekueche, which is a thin crust pizza with cheese and bacon; and choucroute, which is sauerkraut with various meats and potatoes. Alsace is also famous for its Christmas markets, where you can find festive decorations, crafts, and mulled wine.

              <h3>Music</h3>
              <p>
                I am obsessed with music, mostly pop from the late 2000's and vocaloid. Vocaloid music is made using a voice synth program, and the most famous one is Hatsune Miku.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I love about vocaloid is the sheer variety of genres, and how the different producers use the voice of the virtual singer in very unique ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first songs in my Spotify "on repeat" playlist right now are Salamander by DECO*27 and Pall.SENSATION by Yunosuke. They are so good!

              <h3>Digital Art</h3>
              <p>
                During the 2020 lockdown, I had the random urge to buy an iPad with the pencil, and try to learn digital art. I mostly use Clip Studio Paint, a software used by most Japanese digital illustrators. I am very far from having the level I am aiming for, but I am good enough to be satisfied with my work!
              </p>
              <p>
                I post most of my works on my Instagram. My main content is variety fanart, even though I am unfortunately suffering from brainrot for certain characters, like Thoma from Genshin Impact or Kaito from Danganronpa V3.

                alt="Thoma fanart"
                class="favorite-card-image"
              />
              <h3>Videogames</h3>
              <p>
                Ever since I was 6, I have been playing videogames. My first game was Super Mario Galaxy for the Wii, and it still is my favorite of all time! Some of my favorite genres are j-rpgs (Xenoblade, Persona), visual novels (Danganronpa, Ace Attorney), and rogue-likes (Binding of Isaac). I like all sorts of games!
              </p>
              <p>
                I am writing this on May 11th, so the new Zelda game is still not out, but it will be on the day of this presentation and I can predict I will have already played it for at least 15 hours!
